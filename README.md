# **Easy-Compact**

Easy-Compact is a registry entry that integrates Windows' native Compact command into the right-click context menu. It allows users to easily compress files and folders directly via the right-click menu without the need to manually enter commands.

Compact compression effectively reduces the disk space occupied by files in the Windows system while maintaining normal file read and write operations—an efficient, lossless system-level compression method.

Through this registry entry, users can compress files or folders using four different algorithms: XPRESS4K, XPRESS8K, XPRESS16K, and LZX, with corresponding decompression support.
